# MeisPATCHER

It was one of my first programs that i wrote when i learning programming.
It just kills process, it does not patch anything, it just a cool name for useless utility. Meis is a bad production because lacks of features of it's rivals. It's just a basic winform application.
Time to archive my first program and my memories too.
